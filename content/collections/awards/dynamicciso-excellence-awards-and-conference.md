  As we move into 2023, cybersecurity leaders continue to grapple with the daunting task of building a cyber-resilient enterprise against the backdrop of a continuously evolving global threat landscape. 
  We are witnessing malware operators implementing anti-analysis techniques to frustrate defenders, threat actors disguising attacks by obfuscating code, an unprecedented surge in ransomware and cryptojacking, and the hazards of adversarial AI and other multi-faceted social engineering attacks.
overview_text_paragraph_2: 'The task ahead requires that security practitioners stay vigilant. To not just understand TTPs and attack methodologies and improve mean time to detect; but also to swiftly respond, remediate and recover from incidents, thus helping create resilient enterprise information infrastructures.'
overview_text_paragraph_3: |-
  Against this increasing complexity and the unrelenting pressure on an organization's limited cybersecurity resources, security teams have continued to do an incredible job, prevailing against the most adverse scenarios thrown at them. 
  We believe these efforts and stories are distinctly worthy of recognition, and we honor these cyber-warriors for their contributions toward establishing a cyber-secure ecosystem.

    label: 'Blueprint for Next-Gen SOC: Juxtaposed With XDR'
    content: |-
      In the current threat environment, SOC teams continue to face the pressure of detecting intrusion as quickly as possible before it becomes a significant security incident. With so many point products in use in a typical organization, it is often time-consuming and challenging for the SOC team to search through the noise to find important alerts that may indicate the presence of a threat in the environment. 
      SecOps is more difficult today than it was two years ago. Improvements are ongoing as teams adopt future-forward practices, including XDR deployment.  
      However, it is critical to understand what XDR is, what it is not, and how it’s increasing SecOps efficiency and enabling the SOC team to detect, respond, and remediate threats across all attack channels in real time. 
      The session will cover: 
      -Popular myths and realities about XDR  
      -How to embed XDR into the existing threat detection framework to enhance SOC capabilities 
      -Understanding the critical pieces of the XDR puzzle

    content: |-
      When it comes to cybersecurity, the CEO matters. Today, CEOs are recognizing the CISO’s role because it includes revenue protection, brand resilience and employee security. Cyber is an operational and existential risk for a business. How senior management provides support can impact how well an organization is protected from pervasive cyberthreats. The goal is to make sure the CEO understands the threat well enough to be able to mitigate it. It is imperative to use business language and shift the conversation away from technology and cyber language. But 2023 will be the year for CEOs to ask their CISO "what more can we get from what we already have?" Maximizing the coverage and protection of your existing tools and team and not letting your guard down must be the focus in 2023.

    label_day2: '(Panel) Skill Gap in Cybersecurity: Innovative Methods CISOs Are Deploying'
    content_day2: |-
      As the threat landscape continues to deteriorate, criminals learn and use new techniques, and devastating attacks such as ransomware surge, security leaders struggle to fill a critical shortage of skilled talent. With the lack of sufficiently skilled security professionals to meet the needs to protect organizations, industry leaders must look for new ways to recruit and retain talent - who leverage next-generation technologies like automation - to close gaps before it's too late. 
      The panel will discuss: 
      -How smart CISOs are closing the cybersecurity skill gap 
      -Initiatives to retain top-notch employees during the current cybersecurity workforce shortage 
      -Reskilling and upskilling of existing workforce versus hiring

      The panel will discuss:  
      -CISO technology priorities in 2023   
      -Key tactical and strategic approaches to tackle threats in 2023   
      -Essential components to building a cyber-resilient enterprise
