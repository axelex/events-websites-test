hero_title: 'SECURING ENDPOINTS WITH ZERO TRUST APPROACH'
overview_text_paragraph_1: 'Organizations are reporting an increase in endpoint security risks. A Ponemon Institute study says 68% of organizations have experienced one or more endpoint attacks successfully compromising data or systems. Modern-day enterprises have an incredibly diverse endpoint landscape accessing data from everywhere. Not all endpoints are managed or owned by enterprises; that means they have different device configurations and software patch levels. If left unattended, untrusted endpoints can become the weakest link in the cybersecurity strategy.'
